# Test Instructions
The code in this directory contains a skeleton console application. You must
write enough code to achieve the following requirements:

1) Given a properly formatted xml or json input file, print (console) the data 
   in the specified output format (xml|json). There are two sample input files
   to use in the sample-data directory. The data is a collection of Addresses. 
   There can be 0 or more Addresses in the collection.

2) The application is run using these commands:
   php console.php data-convert sample-data/data.xml -o json
   php console.php data-convert sample-data/data.json -o xml

3) The console output should contain line breaks and indentation for readability.

4) Although this test is limited to json and xml formats, the application should
   be easily extended to allow other formats (csv, yaml, etc).

5) Add or edit as many php files as needed. Do not rename any existing file. Do 
   not modify the example json/xml files. 

6) When completed, zip the directory (exclude the vendor directory) and submit
   the zip file for evaluation.

## Requirements
Internet Connection
PHP 7.1 cli (if not available, use the optional Docker environment described below)

## Set up the environment
After extracting the zip file, install the vendor libraries:
php composer.phar install

## Optional Docker Environment
The steps below will allow you to create the Docker container which can be used  
to execute this code. If you do not wish to use the Docker container, skip this 
section. Run these commands from this project's root directory.

Replace the "/full/path/to" with your actual full path to the project's root directory
cd /full/path/to/PHPDataTest
docker build -t php-data-test .
docker run -v /full/path/to/PHPDataTest:/var/www/html -it php-data-test bash
